# Greetings Nivedita, I have provided two different Visualization examples on two different datasets that ive used at different points in during my various projects at NEU.


RShiny -

DATASET[1] :-
The dataset contains records college/uniersity data and was used to tackle various analytical and visualisation problems.
I built a Rshiny app using the said dataset for you to check out and explore the dataset through maps and pther visualisations.


1) Open the RMD file in RStudio and follow instructions given with the R code.

Tableau-

DATASET[1] :-
The dataset contains records for Air Quality data and some other metrics for
states in the US . Pollution data is collected from 2000 – 2016 and each of the
five pollutants included has its own five columns of metrics.

the data set is included as a tableau hyperfile to reduce size and help compatibility.

The entire vis book  can be viewed publicaly online (but i have provided an offline copy as well)
